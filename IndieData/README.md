WARNING: Rough hacks be here. This Injectable Application was built in a few hours as a proof of concept for maintaining local storage of personal semantic data.

This application accepts a query string which is then checked against the App's data, before the data is optionally returned to the querying context.

This is a proof-of-concept application implemented during [Indie Web Camp 2013](http://indiewebcamp.com/2013), do not expect everything to be elegant or working.
